# Project 1 : Tic Tac Toe

<br>

## What is Tic Tac Toe?

A game in which two players seek in alternate turns to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal with either three O's or three X's drawn in the spaces of a grid of nine squares.

Tic-Tac-Toe is one of the simplest games you can play with pen and paper and now on computer and on mobile also.


## Rules of the game



 Here are the rules:
- Player 1 mark 'X' on any cell
- After that, Player 2 can mark 'O' on any cell except the one, on which, player 1 already put his 'X' mark.
- Players take turns marking empty boxes in a 3 Ã— 3 grid.
- To win, you must get your three marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally).
- If nobody gets three in a row and all boxes are full, then the game ends in a draw.
